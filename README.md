# Sensor Reader Application
###  What is a mobile phone sensor?
A mobile phone sensor is a component used in mobile phones, the purpose of which is to detect changes in the environment (such as changes in brightness, magnetic fields, temperature, and gravity) and movement (such as the phone being moved, flipped, or picked up), and convert them into electronic signals that can be processed by the phone.

A mobile phone sensor consists of precision components, which are sensitive to sources of external interference and easily damaged. Avoid dropping your phone or using it in environments with strong magnetic fields, abnormal humidity, or extreme temperatures to avoid damaging its sensors.

Types of phone Sensors available in phones and uses:-
1. Accelerometer
2. Gyroscope
3. Barometer
4. Heart Rate Sensors
5. Fingerprint Sensors
6. Ambient light
7. IR sensors
8. Camera sensors, etc.

The main purpose of this app is to read sensors data simultaneously from all
the sensors and perform simple functions on it to get orientation of phone or locations of phone on earth using
Gps Sensors and detecting whether user in danger by motion sensors and loudness senors
 using Machine Learning.
